## Quick Start

### 1. Export Metafield Definitions

Export definitions from your source store:

```bash
python export_metafields.py --store source-store.myshopify.com
```

This will create a JSON file containing all metafield definitions.

### 2. Compare Definitions

Compare metafield definitions between source and target stores:

```bash
python compare_metafields.py --source definitions_export_source.json --target definitions_export_target.json
```

This generates a `metafield_diff.json` file showing differences between stores.

### 3. Import Definitions

Import the missing or changed definitions to your target store:

```bash
python import_metafields.py --store target-store.myshopify.com
```

### 4. List Current Metafields

View all metafield definitions in a store:
